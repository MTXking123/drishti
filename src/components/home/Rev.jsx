            &ldquo; I recently underwent LASIK surgery with Dr. Manish Aggarwal,
            and I couldnâ€™t be happier with the results. From the initial
            consultation to the post-operative care, Dr. Aggarwal and his team
            were professional, informative, and supportive. The procedure was
            quick and virtually painless, and my vision has improved
            dramatically now which is 6/6ðŸ˜ƒ. I highly recommend Dr. Aggarwal for
            anyone considering LASIK. His expertise and care made all the
            difference! &rdquo;
